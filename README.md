# iFit

iFit was my graduation project for my software engineering bachelor degree where the main purpose of the project was to build a health monitoring application that creates a challenging environment motivating users to do more workout.

I learned during this project how to use many tools such as: Flutter framework/ NoSql/ Firebase/ interacting with google API's.
